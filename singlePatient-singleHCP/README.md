# User story 1 - PoC 1

Personal health data pod from a single patient perspective for primary use in bariatric care.

Patient can set up their POD or can be assigned to a POD set up by someone else, can upload data, invite a HCP, manage and share (sub)set of his/her data with the HCP. 
HCP can view and use (read/write) data for this individual patient. There is not yet a need for a dashboard.

## Assumptions

- Alice has a Pod
- Alice has one healthcare professional that she wants to share her data with
- HCP X uses explicit consent as the legal ground to access the data as Alice is a EU citizen

## Bare minimum

- Alice allows her health data to be read by HCP X for bariatric care - [Example 1](example-1.md)
- Alice allows her heart rate data to be read by HCP X for bariatric care
- Alice allows HCP's reports to be written by HCP X

## Interesting extensions

- Alice allows her health data from 2024 to be read by HCP X for bariatric care
- by source
- for vital interest (bypass consent)
